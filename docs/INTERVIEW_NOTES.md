# PratChat - Interview Preparation Notes

## Project Overview

**Elevator Pitch:**
"I built PratChat, a hybrid AI chatbot that intelligently routes between local ML models and Gemini API based on confidence scores. It uses intent classification, sentiment analysis, and RAG for context-aware responses while maintaining explainability and cost efficiency."

## Technical Deep Dive

### 1. Machine Learning Components

#### Intent Classification
- **Algorithm**: Logistic Regression
- **Features**: TF-IDF vectors (100 features, unigrams + bigrams)
- **Training**: Supervised learning on labeled intent data
- **Output**: Intent label + confidence score (0-1)

**Why Logistic Regression?**
- Fast inference (< 10ms)
- Interpretable coefficients
- Works well with small datasets
- Probabilistic output (confidence scores)

#### Sentiment Analysis
- **Library**: TextBlob
- **Method**: Polarity scoring (-1 to +1)
- **Classification**: Positive (>0.1), Negative (<-0.1), Neutral

**Use Cases:**
- Adjust response tone
- Flag negative sentiment for human review
- Analytics on user satisfaction

### 2. LLM Integration

#### Gemini API
- **Model**: gemini-pro
- **Purpose**: Handle complex queries beyond ML capability
- **Prompt Engineering**: System prompt with PratChat persona

**Persona Injection:**
```python
SYSTEM_PROMPT = """
I am PratChat, an India-born hybrid AI assistant...
[Full persona text]
"""

prompt = f"{SYSTEM_PROMPT}\n\nUser: {message}\nPratChat:"
```

### 3. Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

#### Components:
1. **Embedding Model**: sentence-transformers (all-MiniLM-L6-v2)
2. **Vector Store**: FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)
3. **Knowledge Base**: Text files in `data/knowledge_base/`

#### Workflow:
```
1. Load documents → 2. Generate embeddings → 3. Store in FAISS
4. Query comes in → 5. Embed query → 6. Find top-k similar docs
7. Pass to LLM as context
```

**Why FAISS?**
- Fast similarity search (milliseconds)
- Efficient for < 1M vectors
- No external database needed
- Easy to update

### 4. Hybrid Routing Logic

```python
CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD = 0.7

if ml_confidence >= CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD:
    response_type = "ml_local"
    response = random.choice(intent_responses)
else:
    response_type = "llm_gemini"
    context = rag_search(query)
    response = gemini_api(query, context)
```

**Benefits:**
- 70% of queries handled by ML (free, fast)
- 30% by LLM (high quality, costs API calls)
- Optimal cost-performance balance

### 5. Backend Architecture

#### FastAPI
- **Async**: Non-blocking I/O for concurrent requests
- **Type Safety**: Pydantic models for validation
- **Auto Docs**: Swagger UI at `/docs`

#### Database
- **SQLite**: Lightweight, serverless
- **Schema**: conversations table with intent, sentiment, confidence
- **Purpose**: Analytics and model improvement

#### Error Handling
```python
try:
    # Main logic
except GeminiAPIError:
    # Fallback to cached response
except Exception as e:
    # Log error, return user-friendly message
```

### 6. Frontend Architecture

#### React + Context API
- **State Management**: Context for global state
- **Components**: Main (chat), Sidebar (history)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS (preserved from original)

#### API Integration
```javascript
const response = await fetch('/api/chat', {
    method: 'POST',
    body: JSON.stringify({ message })
});
```

## Common Interview Questions

### Q: Walk me through the request flow

**Answer:**
1. User types message in React frontend
2. Frontend calls `/api/chat` endpoint
3. Backend receives request, validates input
4. ML model predicts intent + confidence
5. Sentiment analyzer processes emotion
6. If confidence ≥ 0.7: return ML response
7. If confidence < 0.7: 
   - RAG retrieves relevant docs
   - Gemini API generates response with context
8. Log conversation to database
9. Return response with metadata to frontend
10. Frontend displays formatted response

### Q: How do you handle model updates?

**Answer:**
1. Add new intents to `data/intents.json`
2. Call `/api/train` endpoint
3. Model retrains on new data
4. Saves updated models to `models/` directory
5. Next request uses new model (hot reload)

**Production approach:**
- Blue-green deployment
- A/B testing new models
- Gradual rollout with monitoring

### Q: What if Gemini API is down?

**Answer:**
```python
try:
    response = gemini_client.generate(prompt)
except APIError:
    # Fallback 1: Use cached response for similar query
    response = cache.get_similar(query)
    if not response:
        # Fallback 2: Generic helpful message
        response = "I'm experiencing technical difficulties..."
```

### Q: How do you prevent prompt injection?

**Answer:**
- Input validation (length limits, character filtering)
- Sanitize user input before passing to LLM
- System prompt clearly defines role boundaries
- Monitor for suspicious patterns
- Rate limiting per user

3. **Complex Query**: "Explain quantum computing" → LLM response (show RAG context)
4. **Identity Query**: "Who are you?" → Persona response
5. **Analytics**: Show `/api/stats` endpoint
6. **Training**: Demonstrate adding new intent and retraining
