Prat.AI - Indigenous Hybrid AI Assistant

Prat.AI is an India-born hybrid AI assistant that combines classical machine learning with modern LLM capabilities. Created by Pratyush under PratWare — Multiverse of Softwares.

Key Features:
- Intent Classification using scikit-learn (TF-IDF + Logistic Regression)
- Sentiment Analysis for understanding user emotions
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) for context-aware responses
- Gemini API integration for complex reasoning
- Local ML models for explainability and customization

Architecture:
Prat.AI uses a confidence-based routing system. When a user sends a message:
1. Intent is predicted using local ML model
2. Sentiment is analyzed
3. If confidence is high, local response is used
4. If confidence is low, Gemini API is called with RAG context
5. All conversations are logged for analytics

Philosophy:
Prat.AI represents India's indigenous effort in hybrid AI — blending creativity, explainability, and efficiency. It demonstrates how developers can build practical, locally tunable LLM-like systems using open tools while maintaining full control and transparency.
